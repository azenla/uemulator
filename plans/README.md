# uemulator plans

Index. Read in order; each file ends with open questions where the answer needs checking against the QEMU tree or the kernel docs.

| 15-legacy-modes.md | real mode, protected mode, compatibility mode, virtual-8086, task switching, firmware boot |
| 16-iommu.md | AMD IOMMU: registers, command buffer, event log, device table, I/O page tables, interrupt remapping, IVRS |
| 17-bios.md | BIOS services as host code, booting a disk's boot sector |

Rules for implementers: `../ext/qemu-uplink` is read-only reference. Behaviour and algorithms are studied there; code is written fresh in Rust, not transliterated. Zero crate dependencies.
