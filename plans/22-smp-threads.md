# One host thread per vCPU

With `MachineConfig::cpus(n)` the guest has n vCPUs. Time-sharing them on one host thread (`plans/03-cpu.md`, "SMP") is the deterministic mode and the only one a freestanding host without threads can run. This plan is the other mode: every vCPU on its own host thread, so a parallel guest workload really runs in parallel. Four simultaneous 40 MiB `md5sum`s finish in the time one takes alone.

`SmpMode` picks the mode (`MachineConfig::smp`, CLI `--smp auto|timeshare|threads`, saved in `machine.toml`):

- `Auto` (default): threads when everything below holds, time-sharing otherwise.
- `Timeshare`: never threads.
- `Threads`: `EmulatedMachine::new` fails instead of falling back.

Threads need: more than one vCPU, `ClockMode::Realtime` (the default), no `verify_jit`, a host clock, and a way to start threads. Hosted builds have `std::thread` and `Instant`. A freestanding build (UEFI, WebAssembly) gets threads only if the embedder gives `MachineConfig::thread_spawner` (a closure that runs a `Box<dyn FnOnce() + Send>` on a new thread) and a `host_clock`; the host must offer real parallel threads (WebAssembly: shared memory and atomics). Without them the machine time-shares exactly as before.

Why realtime only: the virtual clock is the instruction count, which cannot be one deterministic timeline across threads, and Linux checks that the TSC is the same on every CPU. In threaded mode guest time is the shared host clock (`Cpu::wall_clock`), so every vCPU reads the same TSC.

## What is shared, what is private

Shared by every vCPU, as handles (`Arc`) each `Cpu` clones:

- RAM: `ram::GuestRam`, one allocation. It dereferences to `[u8]`, so code that already took slices works, but it is a data race in Rust's terms when a guest races with itself. That is what a guest asked for; anything that needs a defined value goes through `cpu/atomic.rs` (raw host pointers, atomics).
- The code-page flags: `ram::CodePages`, one atomic byte per page, "some vCPU has code from this page".
- The devices: `dev::handle::DevHandle`. `lock()` is a no-op counter bump with one host thread and the device lock (QEMU's "big lock") with several. Reentrant per handle, because guest-facing code often locks in an `if let` scrutinee and again in the body. Every access to a device, interrupt controller or timer happens inside it, so the device models stay single-threaded code. `Devices::current_cpu` is set on every outermost lock from the handle's vCPU number.
- `cpu::vcpus::VcpuLinks`: one `attention` word per vCPU, the exclusive section, the invalidation log, the exit reason.

Private to a vCPU: registers and everything architectural, the soft TLB, the decode cache, and its **jump cache** (a `Jit` handle, `Jit::sibling`). The code cache itself is shared, see "The shared JIT cache" below.

## Signalling

A vCPU looks only at its own `attention` word, at block boundaries (`before_step`, which runs at least every `EVENT_INTERVAL` = 4096 instructions even inside chained JIT blocks, and per instruction in the interpreter). Nobody writes to another vCPU's `Cpu`, with one exception, the exclusive section below.

| bit | set by | meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| IRQ, NMI, START | the device model, at every release of the device lock (`Devices::publish_wake_hints`, recomputed from scratch from the local APICs and the PIC) | a deliverable interrupt, an NMI, an INIT or start-up IPI is waiting. The hot loop reads these instead of taking the device lock every block |
| EXCLUSIVE | `Cpu::with_exclusive` | park at the next boundary |
| INVALIDATE | `VcpuLinks::publish_invalidation` | translations of some pages are stale |
| EXIT | `VcpuLinks::request_exit` | the machine is ending |

A halted vCPU sleeps in `Waker::wait` (park with a timeout; 100 ms, or 1 ms while an `mwait` watch has to be polled). New device bits and EXIT unpark it. EXCLUSIVE and INVALIDATE do not: a halted vCPU is not running, and it handles both before it executes anything.

The device thread is the thread that called `run_threaded`. It ticks the devices (PIT, HPET, every local APIC timer, the virtio queues, the UART) at the earliest deadline or every millisecond, whichever is sooner, so host input is seen within a millisecond. A vCPU that touched the devices wakes it if it sleeps (`poke_device_thread`), so a virtio notify does not wait out the millisecond. The same thread turns `reset_requested`, `shutdown_requested` and the stop flag into an exit, and calls the embedder's poll hook. Device time only moves forward under the device lock (`Devices::clamp_time`): a vCPU may have sampled the clock before waiting for the lock, and a counter read at the older time would run backwards for the guest. On a freestanding host the device thread waits in the poll hook (`poll(true)`) instead of sleeping; a halted vCPU thread there can only spin (`Waker::wait`), so the embedder's threads should be ones it does not mind burning.

## Exit

The first vCPU to leave `run_slice` records its reason (`request_exit`; first wins), which sets EXIT everywhere. `run_threaded` returns once every thread has handed its `Cpu` back, so a reboot (`reboot(true)`) rebuilds a whole new set. A panicking vCPU thread reports `Internal` instead of hanging the machine (`ThreadGuard`).

The machine ends with `Shutdown` when every vCPU is halted, none is waiting for a start-up IPI with interrupts enabled (`wakeable`), and no NMI is pending: the `cli; hlt` of a guest that powered off without ACPI. A halted BSP with an AP still working does not end the run.

## Exclusive section

`Cpu::with_exclusive(f)` runs `f` with every other vCPU parked at a block boundary or halted. It is QEMU's `start_exclusive`: one owner at a time (an owner waiting for the lock stays parkable, because the current owner is waiting for it), `running` counts the vCPUs that are executing, the owner sets `exclusive_requested`, sets EXCLUSIVE on the others and waits for the count to reach zero. Entering the running state increments the count first and then checks the flag; the owner sets the flag first and then reads the count; so one of them sees the other. Never call it with the device lock held.

It is used for two things:

1. **Flagging a page as code** (`mark_code`). The flag is set, the fence runs, every vCPU's soft TLB loses its write tags for the page (`revoke_write_tags_for`, done by the owner on the parked vCPUs' `Cpu`s through `VcpuLink::cpu`), and only then does the caller read the guest bytes to decode. A store by another vCPU is then either already in those bytes or takes the slow path, sees the flag and invalidates. All three decode paths (`fetch_decode`, the JIT's `translate`, the straddling-instruction path) flag before they read.
2. **A locked access no host atomic covers** (see below): split across a page, not naturally aligned, or a 16-byte compare-exchange where the host has no 16-byte atomic.

## Self-modifying and cross-modifying code

A store to a page with the flag set takes the slow path (`phys_write`): it stores, fences, then checks the flag (the other half of the Dekker pair above) and calls `Cpu::code_written`. That drops this vCPU's translations of the page, clears the flag and appends the page to the shared invalidation log, setting INVALIDATE on every other vCPU, which drops its own translations at its next boundary (`drain_invalidations`; a vCPU that fell more than 4096 entries behind throws everything away instead). Device DMA does the same from the device thread (`GuestMem::write_raw` stores, fences and then records the code pages it hit; the thread publishes them).

Another vCPU may therefore run a stale translation for a few instructions after the store. That is permitted: cross-modifying code must be synchronized by the guest (SDM vol. 3, 8.1.3), with a serializing instruction on the executing CPU, which Linux's `text_poke` does with an IPI. An interrupt is delivered only after `thread_attention` has applied the log, so the IPI is a barrier by construction, and `cpuid` asks the running block to end (`Cpu::serialize`) when invalidations are pending.

`flush_decode` does not clear flags in threaded mode (other vCPUs' caches depend on them).

## Atomics and ordering

x86 is TSO. Acquire loads and release stores are exactly that and are plain `mov`s on an x86 host; on aarch64 they are `ldar`/`stlr`, which is what makes a guest spin lock (`lock cmpxchg` to take it, a plain `mov` to release) work. QEMU declines to enable multi-threaded TCG for an x86 guest on an aarch64 host by default for this reason; here it is on and paid for:

- Interpreter: with `Cpu::ordered_memory` set, `mem_read`, `mem_write`, `phys_read`, `phys_write` and the page walker use `atomic::load`/`store`. Natural alignment makes one host atomic; every other size from 1 to 8 (including the 3, 5, 6, 7 byte pieces of a page-straddling access) is an exact-width copy with a fence. Reading or writing a whole `u64` there takes in the neighbouring bytes (the first version did, and zeroed the instruction after a straddling `cmpxchg16b` in kernel text; `every_size_up_to_eight_touches_exactly_its_bytes` and `ordered_memory_accesses_touch_exactly_their_own_bytes_at_every_offset` pin it).
- aarch64 JIT: with `Jit::set_ordered_memory`, `Gen::load_access` emits `add; ldar` and `store_access` `add; stlr`, and `tlb_probe` sends a misaligned access to the slow path, because `ldar`/`stlr` fault on one. Blocks compiled before the flag was set are plain, so it is set before the first translation. The x86-64 JIT needs nothing.
- Locked instructions (any `lock`-prefixed read-modify-write, and `xchg` with memory, which is locked without the prefix) are atomic through `Cpu::exec_locked`, not a second implementation of each. The instruction runs normally with `Cpu::rmw` armed; its `load_operand` of the destination becomes `locked_load` (translate for writing, read atomically, remember address, size and value) and its `store_operand` becomes `locked_store`, a compare-exchange of the remembered value. If another vCPU got there first the store fails with `Exception::AtomicRetry`, the registers and flags are restored and the instruction runs again. `cmpxchg8b` goes through the same two calls; `cmpxchg16b` is a 16-byte host atomic (`ldaxp`/`stlxp` on aarch64, `cmpxchg16b` on x86-64). Where no host atomic applies, the instruction is re-run under `with_exclusive` with `Rmw::Plain` set, so that `exec` does not take the locked path again from inside the section (that waited for itself forever; `with_exclusive` also runs a nested request in place). An instruction with a memory operand that finishes still armed or loaded bypassed the pair and was not atomic: `check_locked_instruction_was_atomic` asserts under `debug_assertions` and logs once otherwise. The JIT never inlines a locked instruction or `xchg`/`cmpxchg`/`xadd`; they go through `helper_exec` into this code.
- Page-table Accessed/Dirty updates, of the guest's tables and of the nested (NPT) tables a guest hypervisor keeps, are compare-exchanges on the entry and walk again when it changed (`update_ram_u64`/`u32`), as hardware does. A plain read-modify-write would race Linux's atomic `ptep_set_wrprotect` (copy-on-write on fork) and write the old writable bit back.

Rosetta runs x86 code with hardware TSO on, so ordering bugs show only in a native aarch64 test run.

## Not supported, and costs

- `verify_jit` (lockstep needs one deterministic timeline) and firmware images and the BIOS disk shim (as with time-sharing).
- The machine reserves one 480 MiB code mapping (lazily committed), shared by every vCPU. A misaligned access on aarch64 takes the slow path.
- The device lock is one lock: guest MMIO and port traffic from many vCPUs serializes on it. Local APIC accesses are MSRs in x2APIC mode and take it too.

## The shared JIT cache

One `SharedJit` per machine (`jit/native.rs`): the code buffer, the block table behind a mutex, a validity byte per block, a flush epoch, a count of invalidations. A vCPU holds a `Jit` handle on it (`Jit::sibling`, made from the bootstrap processor's) with a jump cache of its own, whose entries are three words and cannot be read while another thread writes them. It was investigated first by measuring: each vCPU used to translate 450k to 900k blocks in 150 to 300 MiB, and two vCPUs shared only 10% of their block keys, because blocks embedded the virtual address they were translated at and ASLR maps the same libc page at a different address in every process (47k distinct physical blocks were translated 794k times by one vCPU, one libc block 467 times). Physical code was 70% common. So the order was position independence first (`plans/06-jit.md`), sharing second. Result on an Alpine boot: 193k blocks and 58 MiB for the whole boot on one vCPU (was 1.64M blocks with a flush), 196k and 64 MiB on 4 and on 64 vCPUs (was 1.96M and 640 MiB on 4).

- **Translation.** `mark_code` and the decode (`fetch_decode` for a straddling instruction, the page walk for its second page) run before the lock, because they can wait for other vCPUs (the exclusive section) or read guest tables. The lock is taken to compile, write and register the block, and never held into `Cpu::with_exclusive`: the vCPUs that section waits for may be waiting for the lock. Compiling under the lock serialises translation across vCPUs; per-vCPU chunks of a segment are the next step if that ever shows.
- **Stale decodes** (landmine, found by a test, see below). The bytes are read outside the lock, so a write can land between the read and the registration, and the write's `invalidate_page` then finds nothing to drop. Two checks under the lock close it. `SharedJit::invalidations` is read after `mark_code` and compared at registration (a write to any page since means decode again). And `invalidate_page` clears the page's code flag under the lock, while registration requires the flag of every page it read: `mark_code` returns early when the flag is set, so without this a translation that saw the flag set, read bytes after the write, and registered after the flag was cleared put a block on a page whose stores no longer call `code_written`, and it stayed stale for good (hundreds of thousands of failed checks in the test within 0.2 s).
- **Invalidation** is global at once: the writer's `Cpu::code_written` calls `Jit::invalidate_page`, which drops the page's blocks, clears their validity bytes and unlinks the patched slots. Other vCPUs' jump cache slots stay until used, and both the chain stub and `lookup` check the validity byte, so none is taken. The invalidation log still wakes the other vCPUs to drop their decode caches; their drain does nothing to the JIT. A vCPU that is running a block when the page is written may finish it (the architecture only promises a serializing instruction before it, and `cpuid` makes the block exit).
- **Flush** (buffer full): the vCPU that finds it drops the lock, takes the exclusive section, resets the table and bumps the epoch; every handle clears its jump cache when it sees a new epoch before it reads it (`Jit::sync`, at the top of `step_block`). All the vCPUs are outside generated code while the buffer is rewritten, and a vCPU that was halted checks the epoch before it runs again.
- **Links** are patched while other vCPUs may execute them: one aligned 32-bit atomic store (`ExecMem::write_word`). aarch64 allows a `nop` to be replaced by a branch under a running thread. On x86-64 the slot is a `jmp rel32` to the next instruction (padded to a 4-byte-aligned displacement), and only the displacement changes.
- **Straddling blocks** are keyed by both physical pages, never linked, and their jump cache slot is tagged so the chain stub misses it; `Jit::lookup_straddler` finds it after checking the page after `rip` still maps where the block was decoded. (Untagged and cached by the first page alone they were wrong across address spaces; left out of the cache they cost a decode on every execution, 4.2M of them in a boot, 3.5% of the boot time.)
- **`ordered_memory`** is a property of the cache: setting it drops any block translated without it. It is set before a second vCPU exists, and a reboot builds a new cache.

## Tests

- `cpu/atomic.rs`: sizes 1 to 8 at every alignment touch exactly their bytes, compare-exchange loses no update across threads, the 16-byte exchange, a message-passing litmus test.
- `jit/native.rs`: a sibling handle finds what another translated, a flush by one empties the other's jump cache, `invalidate_page` clears the flag for every handle, and the stale-decode guards each have a deterministic test with a hook between the steps of `translate` (`BEFORE_INSTALL`, `AFTER_MARK`): remove the generation check, or the flag check, and the test for it fails. `jit/diff_alias.rs`: one physical page mapped at two virtual addresses, a loop that bounces between them through the chain stub (fails without the stub's page-base update, on both backends), return addresses, `rip`-relative operands and fault `rip`s at each alias, one translation for all. Straddling blocks: cached per vCPU, not reused when the next page maps elsewhere.
- `cpu/smp_tests.rs` (threaded, on both engines, many with an aarch64-only failure when the ordering is removed): one vCPU rewrites code 1000 times while two others run it under the cross-modifying protocol (read the version, `cpuid`, run), with every translation held for 1 ms between decode and registration (`PAUSE_BEFORE_INSTALL_MICROS`) so each rewrite lands in the window; without the two guards it fails (387k stale runs before the flag fix), the cache is flushed every three blocks under three running vCPUs (`TEST_BLOCK_LIMIT`; flushing without the exclusive section fails it), INIT/SIPI and shutdown with four threads, 20000 `lock inc`s per vCPU lose no update, a `lock cmpxchg` lock released by a plain store keeps a plain counter exact, the same with `xchg`, message passing with the BSP's JIT code as the consumer, an AP taking an IPI through its IVT, `mwait` woken by a store from another thread, code overwritten by another thread is translated again, a store cannot skip `code_written` after another thread flagged the page, 64 pages flagged by four threads at once, a locked increment of a misaligned dword and a locked add straddling two pages (the exclusive replay), a `lock bts` spin lock, MONITOR armed before the store that MWAIT must see.
- `machine/tests.rs`: a second thread started through the public API, through the embedder's `thread_spawner` (once per vCPU), reboot joins and rebuilds every thread, stop with every vCPU spinning, shutdown when all halt with IF=0, `SmpMode::Threads` refuses the virtual clock.
- Real guests (not tests): Alpine 6.18 with 4 vCPUs and with 64, all of them taking timer and device interrupts and IPIs, TSC stable (`clocksource: Switched to clocksource tsc`), CPU hot-unplug and plug through sysfs, a 150-process fork storm, four parallel hashes in the time of one.
