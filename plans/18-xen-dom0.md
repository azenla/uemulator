# Xen dom0 on a modern AMD machine

Goal: boot a stock Xen with a Fedora dom0 (PVH, x86_64) through UEFI and GRUB, on a machine that looks like a current AMD server part. Success line: Fedora dom0 at a login prompt under Xen; stretch: a PVH domU running inside it. Alpine's `xen` packages are the cheap stand-in for Fedora while developing (same hypervisor, much smaller userspace).

Written by the first session on this work; update the status list as pieces land.

## What Xen needs from the machine

| need | piece |
|------|-------|
| ACPI tables: RSDP, XSDT, FADT, DSDT, MADT, MCFG, HPET, IVRS | `acpi/` in the library (step 1) |
| platform timer (HPET, ACPI PM timer), ACPI power-off and reset | `dev/hpet.rs`, `dev/acpi_pm.rs` (step 1) |
| IOMMU found through IVRS and interrupts remapped | IOAPIC, MSI and x2APIC call `Iommu::remap_interrupt` (step 2) |
| a CPU Xen recognises as AMD Zen: family 19h CPUID, SVM + NPT, x2APIC, AVX2/AVX-512 working | step 3 |
| more than one vCPU | step 4 |
| UEFI: memory map, config tables, runtime services, variables, block I/O, a FAT ESP, loaded-image, GRUB | `crates/uemulator-firmware` (step 5) |
| persistent variables | key-value store provided by the embedder (step 5) |

## Order

1. ACPI and platform devices. Verified by booting Linux with `acpi_rsdp` (boot_params has the field), no firmware needed: `dmesg` shows ACPI, HPET, `AMD-Vi`.
2. IOMMU wiring. A guest Linux finds `AMD-Vi`, enables DMA remapping, virtio devices keep working behind it, x2APIC interrupt remapping is on.
3. CPU model and AVX. Family 19h model, cache/topology leaves, MSRs; AVX checked in a real guest, not only in unit tests.
4. SMP, cooperative round robin on the one host thread. Done.
5. Firmware, key-value store, `quick` support, GRUB.
6. Xen: boot `xen.efi` or GRUB multiboot2 + Linux dom0, then a PVH domU. Done, see "Step 6" below.

## Firmware contract (library <-> `crates/uemulator-firmware`)

- Built for `x86_64-unknown-none` (`rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none`), `no_std`, embedded by the CLI with `include_bytes!` from a `build.rs` that runs cargo for the firmware crate into its own target dir. The library only sees an opaque image: `MachineConfig::uefi_firmware(image)`.
- The CPU starts at the image's entry in 64-bit mode, identity-mapped low 4 GiB, interrupts off, with RDI pointing at a `FirmwareHandoff` page (RAM size, RSDP address, ACPI table region, the PCI ECAM base, the key-value device ports). The library builds the ACPI tables host-side because it knows the topology (and owns `Iommu::ivrs_table`); the firmware publishes them as EFI configuration tables.
- Key-value store: `trait KeyValueStore` (get, set, delete, list by prefix) in the library; a file-backed implementation (hosted only); a port-I/O device the firmware's `GetVariable`/`SetVariable`/`GetNextVariableName` use. `quick` machines get `nvram.kv` in their directory.
- Disks are the existing virtio-blk functions; the firmware carries a small polling driver, a GPT parser and a read-only FAT reader for the ESP.
- Console is the 16550.

## Status

Steps 1, 2 and 4 are done and checked in real guests (the interpreter and the JIT run the same code; nothing under `jit/` changed).

- `MachineConfig::acpi` (default on) publishes RSDP rev 2, RSDT/XSDT, FACS, FADT rev 6, DSDT, MADT, MCFG, HPET and, with `MachineConfig::iommu`, IVRS at 0xE0000, marked ACPI data in e820. The default command line drops `acpi=off`; `acpi(false)` restores the table-less machine, and `Platform` hosts keep `acpi=off`.
- Devices: ACPI PM1 block and 24-bit PM timer (S5 write = `ExitReason::Shutdown`, FADT reset register = reset), a three-timer HPET (I/O APIC pin or FSB delivery), PCIe ECAM for bus 0, MSI-X on every virtio function, a Linux-compatible `_PRT` and the interrupt line plumbing (SCI on IRQ 12).
- IOMMU: all interrupt sources meet in `Devices::deliver`, which remaps through the IOMMU once the guest enables it; the IOMMU's event/completion interrupts reach the LAPIC (MSI, or IntCapXT with XTSup); IRTEs honour the 32-bit destination under XTEn; virtio functions offer `ACCESS_PLATFORM` behind the IOMMU; the CLI has `--iommu`.
- Guests: Alpine 6.18 virt kernel (no AMD IOMMU driver): ACPI parsed without errors, `hpet` and `acpi_pm` clocksource candidates (the kernel settles on `tsc`), I/O APIC interrupts, virtio-pci with MSI-X, virtio disk read/write and virtio-net through the NAT, `poweroff` through ACPI S5. Debian trixie 6.12 installer kernel with `--iommu`: `AMD-Vi: Interrupt remapping enabled`, `X2APIC enabled`, `IR-IO-APIC`/`IR-PCI-MSIX`/`IOMMU-MSI` in `/proc/interrupts`, virtio-net pings through the IOMMU, `reboot: Power down` through S5, no unhandled IRQs.

Known gaps: no SMP; virtio-blk behind the IOMMU is only unit-tested (no cached guest with both `AMD_IOMMU` and `virtio_blk` built in); interrupts that need the IOMMU's interrupt table and are raised on the CPU's polling path wait for the next device tick (at most 4096 instructions); no power button, GPE blocks, S3/S4 or hotplug; the 20th virtio function (PCI slot 0x14) shares its device-table entry with the I/O APIC's requester id; the BIOS boot path (`boot_disk`) does not publish ACPI tables.

- Step 5 (firmware): done except GRUB multiboot2, Xen and shim, which are untested. `crates/uemulator-firmware`, the key-value store, `quick` machines with `firmware = "uefi"` and `nvram.kv`; the Linux EFI stub and Debian GRUB 2.12 boot Alpine to userspace and efivars persist across resets. See `19-uefi-firmware.md`.

- Step 3 (CPU model and AVX), done except what needs steps 1 and 2 to show: `cpu/cpuid.rs` is a Zen 4 (family 19h model 11h stepping 1, signature 00A10F11, "AMD EPYC-Genoa Processor") with SVM + NPT + NRIPS + VMCB clean + flush-by-ASID (decode assists, the pause filter, AVIC and the TSC ratio MSR are not implemented and not advertised), x2APIC, XSAVE with correct sizes in both formats (XSAVEC/XSAVES/XGETBV1), invariant TSC, cache/TLB/topology leaves (0xB, 0x8000001D, 0x8000001E, 0x80000008 ECX) consistent with `Cpu::topology` (cpu count, threads per core, x2APIC id; defaults to one processor, to be driven by the SMP work), the AMD workaround MSRs as stored registers (HWCR, LS_CFG, DE_CFG, BP_CFG, the legacy perf counters, PATCH_LEVEL). A guest Linux 6.18 prints the Zen 4 identity, `xsaves`/compacted format and no PMU or microcode complaints. AVX was investigated in a real guest (see 03, "Real-guest check"): VEX instruction semantics match QEMU TCG bit for bit; the failures were missing instructions (`vpsubsw` EVEX, `vdbpsadbw`, SHA, BF16, ADX) and `clwb` executing as xsaveopt, all fixed. Not done: Xen itself has not been booted (it needs steps 1, 2, 5), so "no warnings from Xen" is not verified; leaf 0x1F, PKU, LA57, SSE4A, MWAITX, RDPRU, INVLPGB, perfctr_core and IBS are absent on purpose.

- SMP (step 4): `MachineConfig::cpus(1..=64)`, `--cpus`, `cpus` in `machine.toml`; design and semantics in `plans/03-cpu.md` ("SMP") and `plans/07-devices.md` ("LAPIC and IOAPIC"). Linux sees N vCPUs from the MADT, starts them with INIT/SIPI (x2APIC and xAPIC), runs IPIs, TLB shootdowns and CPU hotplug; Alpine 6.18 on the JIT (4 and 64 vCPUs) and the interpreter, Debian 6.12 with `--iommu` (cluster x2APIC with interrupt remapping). Default stays 1: the vCPUs share one host thread, so more of them cost host time without adding speed. Xen should set the count explicitly. CPUID's topology leaves are minimal (`Cpu::smp_cpuid`) and will need the Zen 4 model's real layout (leaf 0x8000001E) merged in.

Known gaps: virtio-blk behind the IOMMU is only unit-tested (no cached guest with both `AMD_IOMMU` and `virtio_blk` built in); interrupts that need the IOMMU's interrupt table and are raised on the CPU's polling path wait for the next device tick (at most 4096 instructions); no power button, GPE blocks, S3/S4 or hotplug; the 20th virtio function (PCI slot 0x14) shares its device-table entry with the I/O APIC's requester id; the BIOS boot path (`boot_disk`) does not publish ACPI tables.

## Step 6: Xen 4.21 with a PVH Linux dom0 and a PVH domU (done with Alpine)

Verified end to end (Alpine 3.24: `xen` and `xen-hypervisor` 4.21.2, `linux-lts` 6.18.59, `grub-efi` 2.14), 2 vCPUs, 3072 MiB, `--iommu`, UEFI firmware, JIT on. Key log lines: `Xen 4.21.2 (c/s ) EFI loader` / `(XEN) Bootloader: GRUB 2.14`, `(XEN) Brought up 2 CPUs`, `(XEN) HVM: SVM enabled`, `(XEN) Interrupt remapping enabled`, `(XEN) *** Building a PVH Dom0 ***`, dom0 `Hypervisor detected: Xen HVM` (PVH), `xenstored`/`xenconsoled` started and `localhost login:` on `/dev/hvc0`; `xl info` prints `xen_version : 4.21.2`, `xl list` shows `Domain-0`, and `xl create` of a PVH domU (`type = "pvh"`, the dom0's own `vmlinuz-lts` and `initramfs-lts`, 256 MiB, 1 vCPU) boots Linux and its initramfs, which prints on the domU console (it then stops at the emergency shell because the domU has no root disk); `xl list` shows `d1`. Host wall-clock (Apple Silicon, aarch64 JIT): GRUB menu entry 0 s, Xen banner 3 s, `Brought up` 5 s, dom0 Linux 8 s, dom0 init 12 s, login prompt 26 s; the domU is at its initramfs shell within 60 s of `xl create`. Nested SVM is not a bottleneck at this size; the dom0 boot is dominated by the Alpine userspace start-up.

Reproduce (all under `hack/xen/`, with `UEMULATOR_HOME` pointing at a scratch directory, never at a machine you care about):

1. `uemulator quick create xendev --install alpine --firmware uefi --cpus 2 --memory 3072 --iommu --console serial` (serial: Xen owns the 16550 and forwards its input to dom0's `hvc0`; a virtio console would never reach the Xen dom0 console).
2. `expect hack/xen/guest.exp xendev LOG hack/xen/install.sh 900 --boot-from installer` partitions the disk (GPT, 256 MiB ESP, ext4 root), installs `alpine-base linux-lts xen xen-hypervisor xen-qemu grub-efi` with `apk --root`, sets root's password to `xen`, enables `xenstored`/`xenconsoled` and runs `grub-install --removable` (about two minutes of host time; it needs the NAT NIC).
3. `expect hack/xen/guest.exp xendev LOG hack/xen/grubcfg.sh 900 --boot-from installer` writes `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, which sources `xen.cfg` from the ESP root. After that the Xen entry is edited from the host without booting: `python3 -I hack/xen/fatput.py DISK 1 XEN.CFG hack/xen/xen.cfg` (`hack/xen/fatcp.py` copies a file out of the ESP). `xen.cfg` is the GRUB multiboot2 entry (`multiboot2 /boot/xen.gz dom0_mem=1024M,max:1024M console=com1 com1=115200,8n1 loglvl=all guest_loglvl=all iommu=debug dom0=pvh`, `module2 /boot/vmlinuz-lts root=/dev/vda2 rootfstype=ext4 rootdelay=5 rw console=hvc0`, `module2 /boot/initramfs-lts`). `dom0=pvh` is required: Alpine's Xen builds a PV dom0 by default (which also boots).
4. `expect hack/xen/stages.exp xendev` prints the wall-clock second of each boot stage; `expect hack/xen/boot-login.exp xendev LOG hack/xen/dom0.sh` logs in and runs `xl info`, `xl list`, `xl create -c` of the PVH domU and `xl dmesg`.
5. xen.efi: `hack/xen/efi-files.sh` (installer boot) copies `xen.efi`, the kernel, the initramfs and a `xen.cfg` to `EFI/xen/` on the ESP; `expect hack/xen/efi-direct.exp DISK NVRAM LOG` boots it straight from the firmware (`advanced boot-uefi --boot-loader \EFI\xen\xen.efi`) to the same dom0 login prompt. Booting it through GRUB's `chainloader` (`hack/xen/xen-efi.cfg`) does not work yet: xen.efi prints `Couldn't obtain the File System Protocol Interface: ErrCode: 0x8000000000000003` because the `DeviceHandle` GRUB gives the loaded image has no SimpleFileSystem; the firmware now derives `DeviceHandle` from the path itself when LoadImage gets a buffer, but GRUB overwrites it with a handle of its own, which the firmware's `locate_device_path` or partition handles do not satisfy; not diagnosed further. Fedora uses `multiboot2`, not this path.

Bugs found and fixed on the way (each with a test where the code is testable in a unit test):

- Far return and `iretq` to a 32-bit code segment in long mode (compatibility mode) raised #GP: GRUB's multiboot2 hand-off to Xen is exactly that (`retfq` into a 32-bit segment, then paging off).
- SVM saved the guest's EFER without LMA at #VMEXIT, so Xen thought a long-mode PVH dom0 was in protected mode and truncated its RIP to 32 bits after the first emulated `cpuid`.
- The AMD IOMMU register window sat at 0xFED80000, the AMD FCH block Linux ioremaps for the reset status; Xen refuses a PV dom0 a mapping of the IOMMU page. Moved to 0xFD200000.
- The JIT kept translated blocks but `flush_decode` (called on every SVM #VMEXIT and VMRUN) cleared the code-page flags that make a store call `code_written`: stale blocks ran old `jmp` targets after Linux patched its own text (alternatives/retpolines) under Xen. `flush_decode` keeps the flags while a JIT exists.
- The JIT paid `icount` only ahead of rdtsc and port I/O; a device load executed by the interpreter helper (Xen's moffs `mov` of the HPET counter) or through a slow-path memory access read the clock a few instructions early. Helpers now pay always and slow paths publish the instruction index (`Cpu::slow_access_insn`, added to `now_ns`). This is what made `--verify` usable here: `--cpus 1 --verify` now works with the UEFI firmware and a disk boot (the twin's disks replay what the main disk returned, `run_verify` accepts two #VMEXITs, and a divergence report prints the code bytes).
- MADT overrides for the PCI/SCI lines said level/active-high while `_PRT` means level/active-low: a PVH dom0 has no legacy PIC, so Linux refused every virtio probe with EBUSY.
- The 16550 reported its receive interrupt as an edge only when a tick sampled the line low in between, and delivered host input all at once: Xen's 128-byte console input ring overflowed on a pasted line, dropping its Enter. Host input now arrives at 115200 baud pace and a drain by the guest counts as the falling edge.
- Firmware: the exception dump prints the bytes at RIP; `LoadImage` with a buffer sets `DeviceHandle` from the path (needed by anything that finds its files next to itself).

Fedora (in progress): Fedora 44 (Cloud Base Generic 6.19.10, 4 vCPUs, `--iommu`, 3072 MiB, NAT NIC, built-in firmware, no EDK2) boots through Fedora's own shim 16.1 and GRUB 2.12 from the image's ESP to a root login in about 60 s of host time (shim first needs `LoadedImage.FilePath` to hold the file nodes only; fixed). `systemctl is-system-running` says `running` with no failed units, `EPYC-Genoa`, 4 CPUs, DHCP and ping through the NAT work, and `dnf install xen xen-hypervisor` (319 packages, Xen 4.21.2) runs to `Complete!` in about 7.5 minutes of host time. Its scriptlet regenerates grub.cfg with a `20_linux_xen` multiboot2 entry. Not yet done: booting that entry (the command lines go through `GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN_DEFAULT` and `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN_REPLACE_DEFAULT`), `xl` and a domU on Fedora. Harness notes: GRUB hides its menu in the stock ESP stub (replace partition 2 with an ESP that shows it for 5 s, edit the kernel line with `init=/bin/bash` once to set a root password and `SELINUX=disabled`, otherwise login fails on the unlabeled /etc/shadow); expect needs `fconfigure $spawn_id -encoding binary` because systemd's UTF-8 ellipsis makes it hang up the pty; the serial tty is 80 columns, so run `stty cols 4000` before long commands. The driver scripts are not in the repository.

Known leftovers: GRUB prints `no suitable video mode found` before booting multiboot2 (the firmware has no Graphics Output Protocol; harmless); Xen warns `Mismatch between expected (0x19e) and real (0) levelling caps` (no CPUID faulting MSRs) and about Entrysign/SRSO microcode (cosmetic); dom0 Linux prints `[Firmware Bug]: TSC doesn't count with P0 frequency!` (the P-state MSRs are not modelled). Not tried: more than 2 vCPUs under Xen, the Fedora shim/Secure Boot path, a PVH domU with a disk or network, `xl` live operations.
