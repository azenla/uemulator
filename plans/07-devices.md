# Devices and time

Port I/O only (no MMIO in v1). Unknown ports read all ones, writes ignored. Devices implement a small trait: `io_read(port, size) -> u32`, `io_write(port, size, val)`, optional `next_deadline() -> Option<u64>` and `tick(now)`.

## Clock (`clock.rs`)

- `now_ns()` = single virtual time. `ClockMode::Virtual`: `ns = icount * NS_PER_INSN (default 2)`, plus warps. `Realtime`: `max(virtual, wall)`; HLT sleeps on a condvar until the next deadline or console input.
- TSC = `now_ns * tsc_hz / 1e9` (advertised 1 GHz-ish; kernel calibrates via PIT, so PIT and TSC must share this clock).
- Timer queue: sorted deadlines from PIT, RTC periodic, (LAPIC timer later). The run loop checks `now >= next_deadline` at TB boundaries and on the icount budget (05).
- HLT with interrupts enabled in Virtual mode: advance the clock to `next_deadline` immediately (skip idle). With no deadline and no input in Realtime mode: block on the condvar. With no deadline at all in Virtual mode and IF=1 the host naps and polls (host input can still wake the guest).
- ACPI power-off is `ExitReason::Shutdown` too: a write of SLP_EN with the `\_S5` sleep type (5) to PM1a_CNT (port 0x604) ends the run at once (checked at the `out`, in `service_events` and in `idle`, so interpreter and JIT agree; a guest that never reads the DSDT can still write it). Linux's `poweroff` on the default machine ends this way (`ACPI: PM: Preparing to enter system sleep state S5`, `reboot: Power down`). Sleep types other than 5 are ignored: the DSDT offers only S5.
- HLT with IF=0 is `ExitReason::Shutdown`: only NMI/SMI/INIT/RESET wake it (SDM vol. 3 6.8) and none exists, so the guest is dead. This is how Linux ends poweroff/halt with `acpi=off` (`stop_this_cpu`: `cli; hlt` loop). Decided in `Cpu::idle` (after stop and reset checks), so interpreter and JIT agree; only IF counts, not the STI/MOV SS shadow (`sti; hlt` waits). A PIC line pending behind IF=0 does not save it. The UEFI hardware-virtualization loop applies the same rule (`hlt_outcome`).

## 16550 UART at 0x3F8, IRQ4

- Registers: RBR/THR, IER, IIR/FCR, LCR (DLAB swaps in DLL/DLM), MCR, LSR, MSR, SCR. Loopback bit in MCR must work (8250 autoconfig probes it).
- LSR bit5 THRE and bit6 TEMT always set after TX (output is instantaneous); bit0 DR when RX queue non-empty.
- IER must round-trip; IIR reflects pending cause (THRE interrupt on IER enable edge, RX-available) and the FIFO-enabled bits (0xC0 when FCR bit0 set) so the kernel detects a 16550A rather than "no port".
- TX bytes go to the console's output queue; RX from `ConsoleHandle::write` raises IRQ4 through the PIC.
- Also stub 0x2F8/0x3E8/0x2E8 as absent (read 0xFF) so autoprobe doesn't wedge.

## 8259 PIC pair (0x20/0x21, 0xA0/0xA1)

ICW1–4, OCW1–3, IRR/ISR/IMR, cascade on IR2, specific/non-specific EOI, edge triggered, ELCR ports 0x4D0/0x4D1 optional. Interrupt acknowledge returns vector = base + irq. CPU polls `pic.has_pending()` when IF=1 and not in an interrupt shadow (STI/MOV SS one-instruction shadow).

## 8254 PIT (0x40–0x43) and port 0x61

Channels 0 (system timer → IRQ0), 2 (speaker gate, used for TSC calibration). Modes 0, 2, 3 at least; latch and read-back commands; counter derived from the virtual clock at 1.193182 MHz. **Port 0x61**: bit0 gate for ch2, bit1 speaker, bit4 refresh toggle, bit5 = OUT2 status. The kernel's `pit_calibrate_tsc`/`quick_pit_calibrate` poll these; get them right or TSC khz is nonsense (and `tsc=reliable lpj=` cmdline is the fallback).

## CMOS RTC (0x70/0x71)

Time registers (BCD, 24h) from host wall clock at boot (optional `fixed_time` config for determinism), status A/B/C/D, NMI mask bit in 0x70, periodic IRQ8 optional, memory-size bytes (0x15–0x18, 0x30/0x31, 0x34/0x35) filled for old probes.

## Misc ports

- 0x92 fast A20 / reset bit; 0x64/0x60 i8042 stub: status 0, command 0xFE → reset request (`ExitReason::Reset`, or an in-library reboot, see 01-api); 0xCF9 reset control; 0x80 POST delay (ignore); 0xCF8/0xCFC PCI config: reads return 0xFFFFFFFF (no devices); 0x3F6.. IDE absent → 0xFF.
- DMA controller 0x00–0x0F, 0x81–0x8F: accept writes, reads 0 (kernel may touch for `dma` reservation).
- Kernel `x86_platform`/`legacy_pic`: with `acpi=off` and no APIC it expects PIC+PIT+RTC; no HPET. With ACPI (the default for `EmulatedMachine`, see below) it uses the I/O APIC, the HPET as a clocksource candidate and the PM timer (`acpi_pm`), then settles on the TSC.

## LAPIC and IOAPIC (`dev/apic.rs`, `dev/ioapic.rs`)

One local APIC at 0xFEE00000 (xAPIC MMIO, or x2APIC through MSRs 0x800..=0x8ff once IA32_APIC_BASE.EXTD is set) and one 24-pin I/O APIC at 0xFEC00000. Advertised in CPUID leaf 1 (APIC, x2APIC, TSC-deadline) together with leaf 0xB (one logical processor).

- **Reset state is the firmware-left virtual wire** (LINT0 = ExtINT unmasked, LINT1 = NMI masked, SVR disabled), so a kernel that finds no ACPI/MP tables still gets PIC interrupts through the APIC (`extint_connected`, QEMU's `apic_accept_pic_intr`: only LINT0's mask bit counts). Linux boots in `APIC_VIRTUAL_WIRE_NO_CONFIG` mode with the TSC-deadline timer.
- **Interrupt path.** Devices still call `Pics::raise/lower`; the PIC logs each line change (`line_events`) and `Devices::route_line_events` feeds it to the I/O APIC, so the same lines drive both controllers as on a PC. IRQ0 maps to pin 2 (the PIT's wiring), the other lines map straight through. `Devices::interrupt_pending`/`interrupt_ack` are what the CPU polls; LAPIC vectors win over ExtINT, and delivery honours TPR/PPR. CR8 is TPR[7:4] and lives in the LAPIC.
- **Level triggering**: an I/O APIC pin sets remote IRR when it sends and sends again after the LAPIC's EOI (broadcast to the I/O APIC through `WriteEffect::eoi_vector`, plus the version-0x20 EOI register) only if the line is still high. Device lines must be routed before an EOI is processed, hence `route_line_events` at the start of every APIC/IOAPIC register access.
- **Timer**: 100 MHz bus clock, divide configuration, one-shot, periodic and TSC-deadline (the TSC is virtual ns). Deadlines join `Devices::next_deadline`, so a halted guest sleeps to the APIC timer.
- **NMI** (LINT1, ICR, I/O APIC entries): `Cpu::nmi_blocked` is set on delivery and cleared by a completed `iret`; NMIs ignore IF and wake `hlt` with IF=0 (which otherwise ends the machine).
- Not modeled: other CPUs (IPIs to them go nowhere, INIT/SIPI/SMI are dropped), the AMD extended APIC space (reads as zero). MSI messages from devices (virtio MSI-X, HPET FSB, the IOMMU) and the I/O APIC's own messages reach the LAPIC through `Devices::deliver`, through the IOMMU's interrupt remapping when the guest has it on (`plans/16-iommu.md`).

## ACPI, PM block, HPET, ECAM (`acpi/`, `dev/acpi_pm.rs`, `dev/hpet.rs`)

Tables are built host-side by `acpi::build` and written to RAM at 0xE0000 (64 KiB inside the BIOS area, e820 type ACPI data; the RSDP is the first 36 bytes, 16-byte aligned, so a BIOS-style scan finds it too) by `boot::load_with_acpi`, which also sets `boot_params.acpi_rsdp_addr` and adds the ECAM window to e820 as reserved. `MachineConfig::acpi(false)` gives the old table-less machine; the default command line then keeps `acpi=off` and without it drops the word (`DEFAULT_CMDLINE` itself keeps it: a `Platform` host has no tables). The BIOS boot path (`boot_disk`) publishes none yet.

- **Tables**: RSDP rev 2, RSDT, XSDT, FACS, FADT rev 6 (full hardware; no SMI_CMD so ACPI starts enabled; PM1a event 0x600, control 0x604, timer 0x608; reset register port 0xCF9 value 6; FIX_RTC, no fixed buttons, no ASPM, no VGA, MSI supported), DSDT, MADT rev 6, MCFG, HPET and with the IOMMU the IVRS. MADT: one local APIC per CPU (`AcpiConfig::cpus`, 1 for now; ids from 255 are x2APIC entries), the I/O APIC (id 1, GSI base 0), IRQ0 to GSI 2, level/active-high overrides for every ISA line the machine drives as level (the PCI INTx lines 5, 9, 10, 11 and the SCI), LINT1 NMI.
- **DSDT** (hand-assembled with `acpi/aml.rs`, structure checked by a mini AML walker in `acpi/tests.rs` and loaded by Linux's interpreter): `\_SB.PCI0` (PNP0A08, `_SEG`, `_BBN`, `_UID`, `_CRS` with the bus, the I/O and memory windows, `_PRT` sending each virtio function's INTA straight to the GSI of its legacy line), COM1, RTC, PIC, PIT, `SYSR` (PNP0C02 reserving the PM ports and the ECAM window, which Linux requires before it trusts MCFG) and `\_S5`. No `_OSC` (Linux grants itself the PCIe features), no processor objects.
- **PM block** (`AcpiPm`): PM1 status/enable (timer, power button, sleep button, RTC, global, wake), control with SCI_EN hardwired on and SLP_EN/SLP_TYP, the 24-bit 3.579545 MHz timer on virtual time. TMR_STS follows bit 23 and gets a device deadline when TMR_EN is set, so an idle guest wakes for it. The SCI is ISA IRQ 12 (level), *not* shared with a PCI line: Linux registers the SCI level/active-high and refuses (EBUSY, "PCI INT A: failed to register GSI") a PCI function that then asks for the same legacy GSI as level/active-low, which is what an unlinked `_PRT` entry means.
- **HPET** (`Hpet`, 0xFED00000): 64-bit counter at 14.31818 MHz (period 69841279 fs) from the virtual clock, three timers (periodic, 64-bit, FSB-capable, route capability pins 20-23, so nothing collides with an ISA line), level timers hold their I/O APIC line until the guest clears the status bit, FSB timers send an MSI (through the IOMMU's remapper with `HPET_REQUESTER`). No legacy replacement routing: the PIT keeps IRQ0. Deadlines are computed from the counter's epoch, so periodic timers do not drift.
- **ECAM** (`PciHost::ecam_read/ecam_write`, 0xE0000000, bus 0, 1 MiB): the same config space as ports 0xCF8/0xCFC for registers below 256; extended space reads zero for present functions and all ones for absent ones. Decoded even with no PCI function, so the host bridge stays visible to a guest that finds it through MCFG.
- **MSI-X on virtio** (`Transport`): capability at config offset 0x84, table at BAR0+0x4000 and PBA at BAR0+0x5000 (BAR0 is now 32 KiB), one entry for configuration changes plus one per queue, per-queue vectors through `queue_msix_vector`, per-entry and per-function masks with the pending bit array. With MSI-X enabled the INTx/ISR path is silent and a completion is a message tagged with the function's devfn as requester (`PciHost::poll_collecting`), delivered by `Devices::deliver`.
- **Not done**: SMP (the MADT can list more CPUs, nothing starts them), power button and S3/S4, GPE blocks, PCI hotplug, the ACPI tables for a BIOS-booted disk.

## MTRR, PAT and machine checks (`cpu/mtrr.rs`, `cpu/mca.rs`)

Validated storage only, because nothing here has caches: MTRR capability/default/fixed/variable registers (reserved memory types and bits are #GP), PAT validation, AMD SYSCFG/IORR/TOP_MEM/TOP_MEM2 (TOP_MEM = RAM size), and an inert machine-check architecture (MCG_CAP/STATUS/CTL and six banks, status always zero) behind CPUID MCE/MCA and CR4.MCE.
