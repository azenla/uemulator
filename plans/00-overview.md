# Overview

## Goal

A small, embeddable x86_64 system emulator in Rust that boots an unmodified Linux kernel (Debian netboot `linux` bzImage, 6.12.x) with a serial console, with no BIOS and no firmware. Design follows QEMU TCG (translate guest blocks to micro-ops, cache them, run via interpreter or host JIT), minus everything not needed to boot Linux.

```rust
let mut machine = EmulatedMachine::new(MachineConfig::new().kernel(bzimage).cmdline("console=ttyS0"))?;
machine.start()?;
```

## Non-goals (v1)

SMP, ACPI/MP tables, PCI devices, virtio, disks, network, BIOS/real-mode boot, AVX/XSAVE, x87 precision beyond what Linux/glibc/busybox exercise, debugger stub, snapshots, x86_64 host JIT backend (stretch, see 06).

## Architecture

```
MachineConfig ──► EmulatedMachine ──► vCPU thread
                                       │
   boot (bzImage → RAM, boot_params)   ▼
                         ┌──────────── run loop ─────────────┐
                         │ irq/exit check → TB lookup → exec │
                         └─────┬─────────────────────┬───────┘
                          decode│                    │exec
                    x86 bytes → uops  ──►  interpreter | aarch64 JIT
                                       │
                 Env (regs, lazy flags, TLB) ── Bus ── RAM / ioports / devices
                                       │
                                  Clock (single virtual time source)
```

Both executors consume the same uop lists, so the interpreter is the correctness oracle for the JIT (see 08).

## Crate layout (single crate, zero deps)

```
src/lib.rs            re-exports only
src/machine.rs        EmulatedMachine, MachineConfig, ExitReason, thread control
src/console.rs        ConsoleHandle byte stream
src/boot.rs           bzImage parsing, loader, boot_params, e820, initial page tables/GDT
src/clock.rs          virtual clock, timer wheel
src/sys.rs            libc FFI (mmap, MAP_JIT, pthread_jit_write_protect_np, icache flush)
src/cpu/{mod,regs,flags,decode,tables,translate,seg,exc,fpu,sse,cpuid,msr}.rs
src/mem/{ram,bus,tlb,mmu}.rs
src/ir.rs             uop definitions
src/exec/{tbcache,interp,helpers}.rs
src/jit/{mod,probe,buf,a64}.rs
src/dev/{mod,serial,pic,pit,cmos,misc}.rs
```

## Locked decisions

1. Interpreter first, JIT second; one decoder, one IR.
2. JIT backend for aarch64 hosts only in v1. Everything else, and any host where the runtime probe fails, runs the interpreter. `JitMode::{Auto, Off, On}` in config.
3. Faulting state is exact: guest RIP and architectural state are consistent at every instruction that can fault (memory access, helper). Instructions commit register writes only after all faulting accesses.
4. Self-modifying code is handled by guest-physical page tracking (Linux alternatives/text_poke write through aliases).
5. IRQ and exit-request checks happen at TB boundaries even when TBs are chained.
6. One virtual clock feeds TSC, PIT, RTC. Default is instruction-count driven (deterministic); HLT warps time to the next deadline.
7. CPUID is a contract: advertise only implemented features.
8. Decoder is parameterized by mode (16/32/64-bit code size) even though only 64-bit is tested in v1; decompressor stubs and far returns may touch compat mode.
9. 0F 18–1F hint space is NOP, including ENDBR64 (F3 0F 1E FA).
10. The library never touches stdio, never calls `process::exit`, holds no global mutable state, and never panics on guest behavior (guest faults are guest exceptions; unimplemented opcodes raise #UD and are logged through an optional hook).
11. Single-threaded guest (one vCPU). Memory ordering concerns (x-tso in the fork) are moot until SMP.

## Risks

- zstd decompression of the kernel payload (11 MB → ~58 MB) is ~1e9 guest instructions before any kernel code runs. Interpreter speed target: ≥50 MIPS in release; JIT target: ≥300 MIPS.
- Decode coverage: the stock kernel and glibc use a wide integer/SSE2 subset plus x87 in a few places. Mitigate with an opcode coverage log (unimplemented opcode → #UD + report).
- macOS W^X: JIT writes need per-thread toggling; chaining patches code, so toggling must wrap patch sites.
