//! One host thread per vCPU. The design is in `plans/22-smp-threads.md`; this is the machinery.
//!
//! Every vCPU is a `Cpu` owned by its own thread, with a private soft TLB, decode cache and JIT.
//! What they share is RAM and the code-page flags (`ram.rs`), the devices behind the device lock
//! (`dev/handle.rs`), and a `VcpuLinks`: one atomic word per vCPU that others poke to get its
//! attention, an exclusive section that stops the world for the rare operation that needs it, and
//! a log of pages whose translated code is stale.
//!
//! A vCPU only ever looks at its own `attention` word, at block boundaries (`before_step`), so
//! no thread touches another's `Cpu` except inside an exclusive section, when every other vCPU is
//! parked at such a boundary or halted.
//!
//! Guest time is the host clock (`ClockMode::Realtime`), so the TSC agrees between vCPUs; devices
//! are ticked by one more thread, the device thread, which runs on the thread that started the
//! machine.
