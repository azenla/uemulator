//! CPUID: an AMD Zen 4 (family 19h, EPYC 9004 "Genoa") with only the features that have tests
//! behind them. Read `plans/03-cpu.md` ("CPUID/MSR contract") before adding a bit: a set bit is a
//! promise that the instruction, MSR or table it describes works.
//!
//! The identity matters to the software that matters. Linux picks erratum workarounds, mitigation
//! tables and perf drivers by family and model; Xen additionally builds its CPU policy from the
//! raw leaves and refuses to run guests that depend on leaves it cannot make sense of. So the
//! leaves a Zen 4 has are all present and consistent with one another (cache geometry and
//! topology agree with each other and with the configured CPU count), and the ones it does not
//! (Intel-only leaf 4, the hypervisor range, IBS, SEV) read as zero.
//!
//! Deliberate departures from the hardware, each so a guest does not run code the emulator would
//! only slow down:
//! - TSC deadline is advertised (AMD has none) because the local APIC model implements it and
//!   guests calibrate the timer far faster with it.
//! - Leaf 7 EDX and `IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES` keep the Intel spelling of the speculation-control
//!   interface (see `sys.rs`), and leaf 0x8000_0021 claims SRSO_NO: the CPU never speculates, so
//!   no mitigation (retpolines, IBPB on entry, safe-ret thunks) is wanted.
//! - 40 physical and 48 virtual address bits, not 52 and 57.
