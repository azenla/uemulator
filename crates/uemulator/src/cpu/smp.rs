//! Several vCPUs on one host thread: a cooperative round-robin scheduler (`Smp`) and the
//! per-vCPU pieces it needs (INIT and start-up, wake predicates, switching the machine-wide state).
//!
//! Each vCPU is a `Cpu`. Only one runs at a time, so the machine-wide state (RAM, devices, JIT,
//! decode cache, the clock) is not duplicated: it lives in the `Cpu` that ran last and
//! `Cpu::swap_shared` moves it to the next one, a dozen pointer-sized swaps. Everything else in
//! `Cpu` is that vCPU's own, including its soft TLB, which is why INVLPG and CR3 writes need no
//! cross-vCPU work here (the guest shoots down TLBs with IPIs, as on hardware).
//!
//! The clock is the machine's instruction count, and `icount` travels with the shared state, so
//! guest time advances by the instructions of whichever vCPU runs and stays monotonic across
//! switches. Guest time therefore runs N times faster per vCPU-instruction when N vCPUs are busy,
//! the price of one host thread; idle (all halted) time is skipped as with one vCPU.
//!
//! The quantum is `EVENT_INTERVAL`: a vCPU gives way at every device event tick, when it halts,
//! and at `pause` (a spin loop is waiting for another vCPU).
