//! x86-64 block generator. Mirrors `emit.rs` (read its module docs for the exit protocol and the
//! lazy flags); the guest flags map straight onto host flags, so a conditional jump, setcc or
//! cmovcc right after an inlined add/sub/logic/inc/dec/neg tests them directly (`Gen::live`).
//! Anything that clobbers host flags (TLB probes, helper calls, the store of a read-modify-write
//! instruction) ends that window; then the condition comes from the lazy flags via `helper_cond`.
//!
//! Instructions without an inline lowering call `helper_exec` (the interpreter). Every way out of a
//! block jumps to a shared stub in `arch_x64::prologue`: `exit_ok` with rax = `retired <<
//! EXIT_COUNT_SHIFT`, `exit_fail` with rax = the helper status and rcx = index of the instruction
//! that stopped the block, or, for a control transfer to a known guest address, `chain` (see
//! `Gen::chain_exit`), which continues straight into the successor block when it exists.
//!
//! Register roles. `CPU` and `TLB_BASE` live for the whole block. `ACC` and `OPERAND` hold the two
//! operands of an ALU-style instruction (rcx doubles as the shift count), `ADDR` the guest address
//! of the memory operand, `VALUE` what a mov-style instruction moves. Any helper call clobbers all
//! of those and the scratch registers, so the slow paths park what must survive in the
//! callee-saved `SAVED_*` registers (the prologue saves r12-r15 on both ABIs).
//!
//! Guest registers are only ever read and written through `Cpu::gpr` in memory. Byte and word
//! writes (al, ax, ah, ...) are plain narrow stores into the little-endian register slot, which
//! merges them without touching host flags; that is what lets flags stay live across them.
