//! WebAssembly block generator. Mirrors `emit_x64.rs` (read its module docs for the exit protocol
//! and the lazy flags), with the differences a wasm host makes:
//!
//! - A block is one function `(cpu: i32) -> i64` in a module of its own (`wasm_encode`). It reads
//!   and writes the `Cpu` and guest RAM directly, because both live in the emulator's linear
//!   memory, and reaches the helpers with `call_indirect` through the emulator's function table:
//!   a Rust function pointer on wasm32 is such a table index (`Addrs`).
//! - There is no host flags register, so nothing mirrors guest flags except the lazy record in
//!   `Cpu` (`store_lazy`). To still make `cmp; jcc` cheap, the operands and result of the last
//!   flag-writing instruction stay in the locals `LHS`, `RHS` and `RES`, and a condition is
//!   computed from them (`Fused`) instead of calling `helper_cond`. The record is stored anyway:
//!   the successor block, an exception frame or `pushf` may read it.
//! - A block leaves for its successor by a tail call to the chain stub (`compile_chain_stub`), the
//!   `lookup_and_goto_ptr` of the native backends: it checks the same things (the event budget,
//!   the exec TLB, the jump cache, the block's validity) and tail-calls the successor, or returns
//!   to the run loop. Every other way out stores `Cpu::rip` and returns `retired << 8 | status`,
//!   and so does every exit when chaining is off (`Addrs::chain == 0`, the lockstep verifier).
//! - The slow path of a memory access is inline (`if`/`else` around the TLB hit), not out of line,
//!   as wasm has no jump to a label in another place.
//!
//! Every guest instruction without an inline lowering runs through `helper_exec`, so coverage can
//! only matter for speed, never for correctness. A wrong helper type or an out-of-bounds access
//! traps and takes the whole emulator down, which is why the TLB probe mirrors `Cpu::mem_read`
//! exactly and the function types are pinned in `wasm_encode`.
